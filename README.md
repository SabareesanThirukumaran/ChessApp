**DAY 1 - The Errors**

This day was a whole lot of errors. Initally, I found difficulty getting my Visual Studio to work properly yet with the power of google, it tought me the fundamentals of planning not just the code but environment. I finished uploading all the assets, creating the background for the board and adding an icon to my window.
