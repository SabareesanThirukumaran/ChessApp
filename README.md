# Chess

**DAY 1 - The Errors**

This day was a whole lot of errors. Initally, I found difficulty getting my Visual Studio to work properly yet with the power of google, it tought me the fundamentals of planning not just the code but environment. I finished uploading all the assets, creating the background for the board and adding an icon to my window.

**DAY 2 - The Progress**

This day I set up the directions of chess piece movements and get all of my vairables ready including overiding operators. Tought me more about planning projects so that it becomes much easier when beginning the code and starting development.

**DAY 3 - Imporvement**

Made some good progress today learning the language and creating has been a breeze thus far. Created the board state and game state so am ready to put in the pieces onto the board now.
